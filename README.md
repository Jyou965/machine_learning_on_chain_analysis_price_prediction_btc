# Project Two: Machine Learning On-Chain Analysis to Predict Bitcoin Prices

__________________________________________________________________________

# Background

In this project, we used three different machine learning models to predict bitcoin prices and test which one would yeild the most accurate results. The models used were Perceptrons (Deep Learning), Random Forest (Ensemble Learning), and Lasso Regression (Supervised Learning). We attempted to account for all three levels of the On-Chain Analysis Framework (shown below) by focusing our analysis on features included in all levels.
